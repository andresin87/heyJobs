## How can I see it in action?

Just install dependencies, build the app and run the express server:
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn run build
$ yarn run server
```

# Tecnologies used
I tried to use a little bit of the main technologies you suggested:
- React
- Material-ui
- Server Side Rendering
- Create React App
- Styled Components
- Redux
- React Router
- Resonsive page
    - CSS Flexbox
- Code splitting (chunks per pagea and AppBar Component).

### (TODO)
- Jest (Testing)
- Refactor to beautify the code structure.
