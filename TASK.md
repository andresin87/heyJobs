# HeyJobs React Assessment Task

Thank you for taking the time to complete this test task! The purpose of the task is to get an idea of your development style: the way you structure code, testing strategy, etc.

## Requirements

* Build a React application which:
   * Displays a list of available jobs.
   * When clicking on a job, user is presented with job details page.
* The app should be server-rendered.
* The app should be responsive.
* Create and use dummy data for the list of jobs. We suggest the following format:
```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Frontend Developer",
    "description": "Comfortable with modern JS stack, experience with React.",
    "employment_type": "full_time"
  }
]
```
* We encourage using following libraries and tools: 
  * [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
  * [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
  * [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
  * [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)
  * [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
